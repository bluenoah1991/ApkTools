Windows:
Download Windows wrapper script (Right click, Save Link As apktool.bat)
Download apktool-2 (find newest here)
Rename downloaded jar to apktool.jar
Move both files (apktool.jar & apktool.bat) to your Windows directory (Usually C://Windows)
If you do not have access to C://Windows, you may place the two files anywhere then add that directory to your Environment Variables System PATH variable.
Try running apktool via command prompt
Linux:
Download Linux wrapper script (Right click, Save Link As apktool)
Download apktool-2 (find newest here)
Make sure you have the 32bit libraries (ia32-libs) downloaded and installed by your linux package manager, if you are on a 64bit unix system.
(This helps provide support for the 32bit native binary aapt, which is required by apktool)
Rename downloaded jar to apktool.jar
Move both files (apktool.jar & apktool) to /usr/local/bin (root needed)
Make sure both files are executable (chmod +x)
Try running apktool via cli
